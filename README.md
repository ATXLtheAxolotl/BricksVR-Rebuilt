# BricksVR

This is the open source mirror of the main BricksVR Unity game. The purpose of this mirror is to assist with ongoing modding efforts and to act as a learning resource for those building games or those just curious about how a game works. Some interesting paths:

`Assets/Scripts` - Most of the app code
`Assets/Resources/BrickModels` - All the brick models

## Running the project

This project is not in a state where it will run. The BricksVR game has dependencies on several paid services including GCP, Normcore, and several premium assets and packages. Everything premium has been removed from this repository. The project is meant as a reference to read and learn from, and not to promote open source contributions or building the BricksVR project.

## Licensing

All assets available in this repository (including scripts, materials, 3D models) are released for free under the MIT license. In short, the MIT license permits virtually all use, distribution, and modification for personal or commercial use. The full license is available in the LICENSE file.

Some premium assets have been removed from this project, including some music and packages that were paid for by BricksVR but cannot be redistributed for free.
