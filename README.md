# BricksVR

This is the open source mirror of the main BricksVR Unity game. The purpose of this mirror is to assist with ongoing modding efforts happening in Discord and to act as a learning resource for those building games or those just curious about how a game works.

I'm also open-sourcing all assets generated for/by BricksVR including Brick models and artwork. This work is licensed under MIT and can be re-purposed or copied directly into personal or commercial projects without attribution.

The game is available for Oculus Quest [here](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4018602774873329/).

## Running the project

This project is not in a state where it will run. The BricksVR game has dependencies on several paid services including GCP, Normcore, and premium assets and packages. Everything premium has been removed from this repository. The GitHub repo is meant as a reference to read and learn from, and not as a way to contribute to the BricksVR project. BricksVR is currently not under development.

## Licensing

All assets available in this repository (including scripts, materials, 3D models) except the BricksVR name and logos are released for free under the MIT license. In short, the MIT license permits virtually all use, distribution, and modification for personal or commercial use. The full license is available in the LICENSE file.

Some premium assets have been removed from this project, including some music and packages that were paid for by BricksVR but cannot be redistributed for free.

## Notes about the project

This was my first Unity project. If you're combing through the code, expect some odd, inefficient, and anti-idiomatic code. I began to focus on better code towards the end of the project but the codebase is still littered with very low quality work.
