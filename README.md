# BricksVR Reforged

This purpose of this project is the continue developing a game named [BricksVR](https://github.com/d12/bricksvr-game).

## Licensing

Some premium assets have been removed from this project, including some music and packages that were paid for by BricksVR but cannot be redistributed for free.

## Notes about the project

This was my first Unity project. If you're combing through the code, expect some odd, inefficient, and anti-idiomatic code. I began to focus on better code towards the end of the project but the codebase is still littered with very low quality work.
